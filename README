Cloudless --- Distributed computational science made easy, in Python

Cloudless provides:

- Transparent remote execution of Python procedures

- Data processing and experimentation pipelines, procedurally,
  but with smart caching and easy interactive plotting

- [[FIXME]] Persistent distributed dictionaries

- [[FIXME]] Logged long-running jobs, via statsd

Cloudless depends primarily on STARCluster.
