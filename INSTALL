1. Be sure StarCluster is installed (e.g. easy_install starcluster)

2. Be sure the directory containing Cloudless is on your PYTHONPATH

3. Add to StarCluster config file (typically ~/.starcluster/config):

[plugin Cloudless]
SETUP_CLASS = Cloudless.starcluster_plugin.CloudlessSetup

Add cloudless to your cluster config, for example:
plugins = ipcluster, cloudless

4. Start a cluster; all the nodes and the master should have access to cloudless.
