# [Cloudless](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project/Cloudless)

Distributed computational science made easy, in Python.

[Cloudless](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project/Cloudless) is part of the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project).

## Cloudless provides

- Transparent remote execution of Python procedures

- Data processing and experimentation pipelines, procedurally,
  but with smart caching and easy interactive plotting

- [[FIXME]] Persistent distributed dictionaries

- [[FIXME]] Logged long-running jobs, via [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd)

[Cloudless](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project/Cloudless) depends primarily on [STARCluster](http://web.mit.edu/star/cluster/).
